instead the game allows you to customize your character's proficiencies and make dramatic changes to your skill set on the fly. also each character's set of statistics such as perception and belief predispose them toward one style of play or another. gameplay is primarily turn-based combat that occurs during randomly generated missions in search of targets or objects. you earn currency experience points and loot (such as weapons and other items) from accomplishing missions and defeating opponents. many missions have multiple stages and while it's possible to finish them on your own it's much more efficient to plow through them with a group of other players. the matrix online allows players to form groups of up to a dozen called crews that are more permanent in nature and multiple crews can come together to form a faction. in addition to fighting foes using hand-to-hand combat guns and viruses characters can create useful items by compiling them. one of the most enticing aspects of the matrix online is the promise of an evolving storyline that develops based on each players' actions ensuring that you will keep coming back not just for the thrill of the game but in order to see how the story turns out. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath. view larger. everquest: evolution and everquest ii as the game that originally helped create the market for the massive multiplayer online role-playing genre the everquest line of role-playing games require little explanation. both everquest games -- evolution and everquest ii -- take place in the world of norrath but in everquest ii norrath has been stricken by a cataclysmic event that caused civilization to virtually collapse leaving only two main metropolises intact. in both evolution and everquest ii you must choose your character's race profession and alignment before you head out in to the world to gain experience win renown and hopefully become rich and powerful beyond your wildest dreams. everquest: evolution features the original game plus all of the expansion packs released so far including the ruins of kunark the scars of velious the shadows of luclin the planes of power and the legacy of ykesha. everquest ii includes the new world order a ton of original content breathtaking new graphics and several tweaks to gameplay such as a purely player-versus-environment gameplay design that removes the original everquest's option of attacking other players. as one of the most participated in and deeply developed massively-multiplayer online games ever created both everquest: evolution and everquest ii will provide you with virtually endless entertainment and challenges.</td>\n",

       "      <td>efrontier's anime studio pro 5 is a complete animation program for creating movies cartoons anime or cut animations. create your own desktop animated shorts in the style of south park and jibjab or use anime studio pro 5 to produce full-length animation for film video or streaming over the web. it's easy to quickly create camera movements and characters. easily create characters and objects. use layering behaviors that are similar to other design programs. a wealth of tools at your fingertips. using keyframes and a timeline test your animations as you design. bone-rigging uses spring-like simulation to calculate dynamic character movement. vector-based tools make quick designs easy. give your characters a voice with papagayo lip-synching software. create sophisticated special effects. anime studio pro 5 allows digital enthusiasts at home to bring their imaginations to life. the program is fun to use quick to learn and easy on your pocketbook. it is an ideal solution for first time animators hobbyists and digital enthusiasts. draw original art import your digital pictures dub and add subtitles to existing videos or choose from many built-in characters to grease your animation wheels and get a feel for the software's capabilities. this program includes everything aspiring artists need to create top quality animations from start to finish -- it simplifies the animation process and empowers artists to create their projects faster and easier than ever before. you'll be surprised by how quickly you can get started. packed with ready-to-use anime style characters you can create your own animations right out of the box. tutorials and sample files show you how to maximize anime studio pro's powerful features giving you the jump start you'll need to begin your first project. once you feel at home with the mechanics of the software you'll be ready to move on to your own art. sketch your original characters and backdrops scan in and import graphics or if you use a pen tablet you can recreate the sensation of drawing on paper. built with vector graphics anime studio pro 5 provides power and flexibility with multiple layering and the capacity to resize images without sacrificing quality. another powerful element of anime studio pro 5 is the use of bones. using the software's bone rigging system you can add a skeleton to any image to bring it to life. with anime studio pro 5 there is no need to create new art for each individual frame as you animate -- just adjust the bones to your desired position and the program will generate the movement for you. you can also count on anime studio pro 5 to help direct your animated action with an intuitive timeline. setting your movements to a timeline makes scene changes feel seamless and natural so the plot of your animated short is easier to follow. no animation is complete without an audio soundtrack. anime studio pro 5 helps you add emotion and style to your animations by adding sound in wav and aiff formats. and once you've completed a project you can publish your results for a variety of media including video tv and web formats. design and layout anime studio pro 5 gives you total control over your canvas and makes it easy for you to organize and complete your project using layers. with this intuitive software under your belt you can set up your 2d canvas to the exact dimensions you want. and with anime studio pro you can even turn your canvas into a 3d stage with x y and z coordinates to easily produce your animation with added depth and dimension. using anime studio pro's vector-based graphics you can freely adjust canvas resolution and size without losing image quality. if you're already accustomed to other graphics-driven programs such as photoshop or quark you'll be pleased with anime studio pro's familiar layer-based workflow. it is an easy and efficient way to organize your assets and create your animation and you'll save time by reusing your art. simply create an asset once and place it on a layer then refer to that layer any time you need to reuse a piece of art. advanced layer features include switch layers which allows you to rotate among all the layers in a set and shows only one layer a time. this saves you a great deal of time when animating body movements or facial expressions. use anime studio pro to rig your characters objects and scenes with the revolutionary bone system that makes the animation process easier than ever before. bones create a skeleton that determines joints or flex points in your artwork. you can then manipulate the bones to move the image into new positions without time-consuming redraws. simple tools let you design dynamic character movement. stop thinking of your drawings as fixed static images -- with anime studio pro you drawings become like soft rubber with stiff wires inside that help you move and position the objects on the screen. bones are never displayed in the final render they're just used as a tool during the animation process. and to make the process smoother and easier to follow you can organize your project using keyframe animation and a timeline. then all you need to do is position your image on the canvas and manipulate the timeline. the software will interpolate the motion between positions for you to create a smooth-flowing graceful transition from one movement to the next. in anime studio pro you can also fine tune your animations with powerful timeline controls such as onion skins tweening and graph mode. and with the pro version you can create animations of any length. once you complete a project you can finish it for web tv film and still formats. with anime studio pro you can output your finished work to a variety of standard formats such as avi mov and flash (swf export for vector based animations). studio pro also makes it easy to transfer your work to other popular graphics programs to utilize assets for other projects or to add color to your art. pro exports to jpg bmp png an tga file formats and even allows you to export your artwork as layered psd files. animation techniques traditional animation was created by drawing frames one after another each frame drawn slightly different from the last. anime studio pro helps you simulate frame-by-frame animation yet drastically reduces the time required from traditional animation. designed to mimic real skeletal structure the anime studio pro bones are interdependent so when you adjust one bone all the other connected bones will move in response. the bone-rigging feature also uses spring-like simulation to calculate dynamic bone movement. this makes a wide range of movements seem real such as jumping waving flabby body parts and bouncing hair. you can also take advantage of anime studio pro's switch layers function to work with a combination of connected movements that occur along a timeline. this is particularly valuable for animating body movements or facial expressions such as lip-synch animations when each graphical layer can be a mouth shape for a different sound. an additional animation feature includes cycling keyframe interpolation which will automatically cycle a section of animation and repeat it over again as many times as you wish. another feature includes onion skins that show the position of objects in your scene at a given point in time -- just click on any point in the timeline to see the onion skins in anime studio pro. in anime studio pro you can use actions -- little clips of animation that are associated with a layer or group of layers -- to create reusable animations for movements that you expect to use repeatedly. tweening adjusts the pace of movements within a given action so you can slow it down or speed it up. and pro's graph mode allows you to inspect an animation curve plotted as values on a graph. this helps evaluate acceleration changes in direction and other properties of motion. anime studio pro includes over 200 sample files and is filled with content that includes the standard anime studio content files such as anime characters aya and winsor backgrounds animation other characters scenery and props. anime studio pro also includes extra samples such as 3d animals 3d movies and samples provided by users that serve as great starting points.</td>\n",

(the camera does such an amazing job of showing you what your death spiral coaster feels like that you might not want to play until at least an hour after you've eaten.) and speaking of the pals -- they are completely personalized fully-animated individuals with unique facial expressions and behaviors. for example teenagers often run straight to the high-excitement level coasters while the younger kids like to stay on the more gentle rides and the older folks tend to complain and chase both sets of kids around. you can even create your own family members and friends and add them to your park where they will actually take pictures that will download directly to your my documents folder. there's also a lot of content to explore as rollercoaster tycoon 3 includes five separate themes including generic spooky western adventure and sci-fi. each theme has distinctive rides amusements and shops as well as animatronics and decorations. the game's sweeping variety lets you do virtually anything from setting up water rides that have mechanical great-white sharks lurching out of the water to creating a roller coaster straight out of your imagination. there are 18 distinct scenarios in the game with two that are only playable when unlocked. beating the apprentice level of difficulty on each of the initially unlocked scenarios will unlock a new scenario but you have to beat the much more difficult entrepreneur and tycoon settings on all the levels to unlock the final two scenarios. when it comes to the creative aspect of the game rollercoaster tycoon 3 will allow players to create some spectacular parks with a level of detail they're sure to love. if you were a fan of the first two versions you'll love this one. but if you never played the originals but love theme parks you owe it to yourself to give rollercoaster tycoon 3 a try.</td>\n",

backup and recovery including synthetic and off-host backups to perform zero impact backups. synthetic backups reduce backup windows and network bandwidth requirements and do not impact the original client. additionally synthetic backups allow for quick client restore from a single backup image to reduce the number of tapes and eliminate the need to restore from incremental backups. the off-host backup feature enables better backup performance and frees the remote computer by processing the backup operation of the remote computer on a backup exec media server instead of on the remote computer or host computer. product information - software type: backup and recovery - software name: backup exec 10d v.10.1 for windows servers advanced disk-based backup option - complete product - features

import graphics or if you use a pen tablet you can recreate the sensation of drawing on paper. built with vector graphics anime studio pro 5 provides power and flexibility with multiple layering and the capacity to resize images without sacrificing quality. another powerful element of anime studio pro 5 is the use of bones. using the software's bone rigging system you can add a skeleton to any image to bring it to life. with anime studio pro 5 there is no need to create new art for each individual frame as you animate -- just adjust the bones to your desired position and the program will generate the movement for you. you can also count on anime studio pro 5 to help direct your animated action with an intuitive timeline. setting your movements to a timeline makes scene changes feel seamless and natural so the plot of your animated short is easier to follow. no animation is complete without an audio soundtrack. anime studio pro 5 helps you add emotion and style to your animations

5 gives you total control over your canvas and makes it easy for you to organize and complete your project using layers. with this intuitive software under your belt you can set up your 2d canvas to the exact dimensions you want. and with anime studio pro you can even turn your canvas into a 3d stage with x y and z coordinates to easily produce your animation with added depth and dimension. using anime studio pro's vector-based graphics you can freely adjust canvas resolution and size without losing image quality. if you're already accustomed to other graphics-driven programs such as photoshop or quark you'll be pleased with anime studio pro's familiar layer-based workflow. it is an easy and efficient way to organize your assets and create your animation and you'll save time by reusing your art. simply create an asset once and place it on a layer then refer to that layer any time you need to reuse a piece of art. advanced layer features include switch layers which allows you to rotate among all the layers in a set and shows only one layer a time. this saves you a great deal of time when animating body movements or facial expressions. use anime studio pro to rig your characters objects and scenes with the revolutionary bone system that makes the animation process easier than ever before. bones create a skeleton that determines joints or flex points in your artwork. you can then manipulate the bones to move the image into new positions without time-consuming redraws. simple tools let you design dynamic character movement. stop thinking of your drawings as fixed static images -- with anime studio pro you drawings become like soft rubber with stiff wires inside that help you move and position the objects on the screen. bones are never displayed in the final render they're just used as a tool during the animation process. and to make the process smoother and easier to follow you can organize your project using keyframe animation and a timeline. then all you need to do is position your image on the canvas and manipulate the timeline. the software will interpolate the motion between positions for you to create a smooth-flowing graceful transition from one movement to the next. in anime studio pro you can also fine tune your animations with powerful timeline controls such as onion skins tweening and graph mode. and with the pro version you can create animations of any length. once you complete a project you can finish it for web tv film and still formats. with anime studio pro you can output your finished work to a variety of standard formats such as avi mov and flash (swf export for vector based animations). studio pro also makes it easy to transfer your work to other popular graphics programs to utilize assets for other projects or to add color to your art. pro exports to jpg bmp png an tga file formats and even allows you to export your artwork as layered psd files. animation techniques traditional animation was created by drawing frames one after another each frame drawn slightly different from the last. anime studio pro helps you simulate frame-by-frame animation yet drastically reduces the time required from traditional animation. designed to mimic real skeletal structure the anime studio pro bones are interdependent so when you adjust one bone all the other connected bones will move in response. the bone-rigging feature also uses spring-like simulation to calculate dynamic bone movement. this makes a wide range of movements seem real such as jumping waving flabby body parts and bouncing hair. you can also take advantage of anime studio pro's switch layers function to work with a combination of connected movements that occur along a timeline. this is particularly valuable for animating body movements or facial expressions such as lip-synch animations when each graphical layer can be a mouth shape for a different sound. an additional animation feature includes cycling keyframe interpolation which will automatically cycle a section of animation and repeat it over again as many times as you wish. another feature includes onion skins that show the position of objects in your scene at a given point in time -- just click on any point in the timeline to see the onion skins in anime studio pro. in anime studio pro you can use actions -- little clips of animation that are associated with a layer or group of layers -- to create reusable animations for movements that you expect to use repeatedly. tweening adjusts the pace of movements within a given action so you can slow it down or speed it up. and pro's graph mode allows you to inspect an animation curve plotted as values on a graph. this helps evaluate acceleration changes in direction and other properties of motion. anime studio pro includes over 200 sample files and is filled with content that includes the standard anime studio content files such as anime characters aya and winsor backgrounds animation other characters scenery and props. anime studio pro also includes extra samples such as 3d animals 3d movies and samples provided by users that serve as great starting points.

       "133  stuffit deluxe 10 is the latest version of this innovative data compression access and management tool for mac os x. this release includes patent pending jpeg compression technology allowing users to compress jpeg images and photos up to 30% with no loss in image quality. the only previous solution available for those looking to reduce the size of jpeg images was to further reduce the quality of the image. stuffit's jpeg compression technology provides a new solution that offers smaller files without any penalty of reduced picture clarity. the product also allows users to view thumbnails for archived jpeg images without requiring them to decompress the archive. stuffit deluxe also offers new features that seamlessly integrate with mac os x 10.4 tiger. the included spotlight importer allows spotlight to index file names for items stored inside stuffit zip and tar archives. when the user performs a search spotlight will now list all the archives on the user's computer that contain files that match the search terms. stuffit deluxe 10 also includes support for tiger' s new automator scripting tool allowing users to compress and expand stuffit zip and tar archives as part of their automator workflows.

       "143  in any given image you may need more than one tool to get the job done. that's why mask pro 4 provides a complete collection of tools that help you take on the toughest masking project. included are tools such as the magic brush which will remove colors while maintaining transparency as well as touch up tools like the chisel which will help you get the edges of your image perfect without any edge halos at all. each tool includes a palette where you can quickly and easily adjust the tool settings. mask pro 4.1 allows you to cut out a subject from the background by assigning keep and drop colors and simply painting away the background. mask pro 4.1 makes it easy to create masks selections and clipping paths on difficult subjects like hair glass and fog all in real-time. the built-in tutorials allow you to quickly learn how to mask even the most complex images. if you have ever spent time creating masks or cutting a subject out of a background you know that the background color is picked up in the edge of the foreground subject as a reflection or halo. this halo effect will prevent your subject from blending with a new background in a realistic looking way. with mask pro 4's color decontamination technology and touch up tools you can say goodbye to these halos forever. with the color decontamination enabled background colors are removed from the edges the of the foreground subject. the edges of the foreground subject are maintained but are now semi-transparent because only the background colors have been removed from those edge pixels. masking images that contain hair can be tricky and often frustrating. this is often because hair is thin semi-transparent in some parts and rarelly has a sharp edge. it is difficult to use a tool that relies on edge detection to mask something like hair or other thin or transparent subjects. mask pro 4 works differently by using color instead of edges. this allows it to
